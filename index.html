    <hr />
    <p>I am Yucheng Shao. Please call me Ben.</p>
    <p>I am generally interested in any application of math in biology.</p>
    <p>I am looking for a grad school.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The projects for the bioinformatic class I am taking focus on the p450 protein family.</p>
    <p>It is responsible for hydrolyzing organic chemical and is found in a large range of organisms.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I was told that I cannot put links onto this webpage (through GitHub).</p>
    <p>Is that so? I found the coding for html kind of fun.</p>
    <p>Below is one of my favorite lizard. :)</p>
